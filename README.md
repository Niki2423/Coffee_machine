As part of my Udemy Python course, I built a coffee machine program that:
1. Takes orders for espresso, latte, or cappuccino
2. Checks if enough resources are available
3. Processes payments and gives change
4. Keeps track of ingredients and money
5. Allows maintainers to turn off the machine
This project helped me practice loops, conditionals, dictionaries, and user input handling in Python. It was a great way to reinforce my understanding of object-oriented programming and automation!
Excited to keep learning and building more projects!
